### Transformation performed to get the data
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
- Labels the data set with descriptive variable names
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
